# Purpose
The purpose of this repo is for code that will report to a display the next arriving train to forest hills station. <br>
This will be broken down by different formats and is for the purpose of learning to program for microcontrollers.
It will start with python and raspberry pi along with a cheap SPI display because of the ease of WiFi, drivers etc. then progress to rust on a specialized microcontroller.
